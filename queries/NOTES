Useful psql commands:

    \t          Tuples only (turns off formatting)
    \g <path>   Send query buffer to server; store results in file
    \i          Perform ops from file as if typed



 * As of about v9, it seems plpy2list (in spoff.py) is redundant.
   It's getting called with list argument instead of strings of
   the form '{1,2,3}'. The current version checkes the supplied
   type and attempts to "do the right thing", which might become
   and unnecessary overhead.
