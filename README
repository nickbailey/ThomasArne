ThomasArne is a database framework based on Postgresql with python
support for the storage and manipulation of musical and performance
data, using Lilypond as a presentation agent.

Thomas (Thomas the Note Engine, aka ToNE) refers to the SQL part of
the processing; Arne (Annotated Retrieval of Note Events) refers to
the presentation part.

Thomas Arne was a rather good English composer:

The project is in its initial stages, but has been used for a couple
of projects involving performance and harmonic analysis. We intend to
let it grow organically through application to problems rather
than second guess what the potential user community might want.
